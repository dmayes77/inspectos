## Category

## What We Are Not
- Not a report writer.
- Not a scheduling tool.
- Not a generic CRM for home services.

## What We Are
- A business intelligence and operations platform purpose-built for inspection companies.
- The system of record for orders, costs, service mix, team performance, and profit.
- The decision engine owners use to price, prioritize, and grow.

## Core Market Gap
- Current market tools optimize inspector efficiency.
- Owners still lack operational truth and margin visibility.
- Revenue dashboards exist; profit intelligence does not.

## Strategic Wedge
- Core object: `order`.
- Why order-centric:
  - Connects labor, service line, referral source, payment, and cost.
  - Enables per-order margin and unit economics.
  - Supports both inspector workflow and owner analytics.

## Competitive Framing
### Current Layer Landscape

  - Which services are most profitable.
  - True cost per inspection.
  - Best referral channels by margin, not volume.
  - Where pricing should change this quarter.
