# InspectOS V1 Roadmap

## Planning Window
- Start: February 2026
- Horizon: next 2 quarters

## Roadmap Structure
- Track A: Market admission (parity)
- Track B: Differentiation (owner decision engine)
- Track C: Trust and data sovereignty
- Track D: AI progression

## Track A: Market Admission (Must Have)
Goal: remove switching friction from incumbent stacks.

### Scope
- Email open tracking.
- Automation triggers and actions.
- CSV export for core entities.
- Agent tagging and usage metrics.
- SMS reminders and notifications.

### Exit Criteria
- Owners can replicate minimum operational workflows currently handled by ISN/Spectora add-ons.
- No blocker remains that forces third-party tooling for basic operations.

## Track B: Differentiation (Build First)
Goal: deliver owner outcomes unavailable in current market tools.

### Scope
- Service profitability dashboard.
- True cost per inspection.
- Referral source value by margin.
- Pricing recommendation engine (rules + analytics driven).
- Multi-service performance comparison.

### Exit Criteria
- Owners can identify top and bottom margin services in one view.
- Owners can see cost-to-serve and net margin at order level.
- Owners can make pricing changes using platform recommendations.

## Track C: Trust and Data Sovereignty
Goal: turn industry trust gaps into product advantage.

### Scope
- Business ID + generated API key management.
- Public Data Charter page.
- Data ownership statement in product and site.
- Tenant isolation documentation in architecture docs.
- Audit trail visibility for sensitive actions.

### Exit Criteria
- Data ownership and non-brokerage commitments are publicly visible.
- Admin users can retrieve/export their business data without support intervention.

## Track D: AI Progression
Goal: sequence AI in adoption order and risk order.

### Phase 1: Generative Assist (Workflow Embedded)
- Finding-to-report paragraph generation.
- Client-facing explanation drafts.
- Repair request language support.
- Manual/AI dual mode with explicit inspector approval.

### Phase 2: Retrieval AI (Cited Knowledge)
- State law assistant.
- Standards lookup assistant.
- Report justification assistant with citations.

### Phase 3: Analytical AI (Moat Layer)
- Margin forecasting.
- Pricing optimization.
- Referral quality scoring.
- Operational health score and trend alerts.

### Exit Criteria
- AI features improve decisions and speed without reducing user trust.
- Analytical models are trained on platform-native order and outcome data.

## Prioritization Rules
1. If parity and differentiation conflict, ship the smallest parity slice then resume differentiation.
2. Features that improve owner decisions beat features that only improve report drafting speed.
3. Trust-risk features (data, legal, compliance) block broad automation rollouts.
4. Any new feature should map to at least one measurable business KPI.

## KPI Targets (V1)
- Gross margin visibility coverage: >= 90% of completed orders.
- Service line profitability visibility: 100% of active services.
- Time-to-decision for pricing updates: < 1 day.
- Third-party tool dependency reduction: at least 3 tools replaced for target customers.
- AI assist acceptance rate (approved output): >= 60% in pilot accounts.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: parity backlog delays differentiation.
  - Mitigation: cap parity scope to admission-only use cases.
- Risk: AI automation triggers trust resistance.
  - Mitigation: ship assist mode first; require approval loops.
- Risk: messaging drifts toward "another CRM."
  - Mitigation: enforce category language in all product and GTM artifacts.
