# InspectOS Product Principles

## 1. Profit Over Productivity
- We prioritize owner decision quality above inspector output speed.
- Productivity features are required; profitability insight is our core value.
- Every major feature should improve margin visibility, pricing decisions, or operating leverage.

## 2. Order-Centric Architecture
- The order is the platform backbone.
- Features should attach to orders first, then fan out to reports, clients, and analytics.
- No feature should fragment source-of-truth away from orders.

## 3. Assist, Do Not Replace
- AI should default to human-in-the-loop.
- Inspector choice is required for AI-generated findings or narratives.
- Trust and control outrank automation volume.

## 4. Workflow-Embedded AI
- AI must appear inside active workflows (order, report, communication), not as separate tools.
- We avoid "export-and-prompt" experiences that make users leave the platform.

## 5. Data Sovereignty by Design
- Customer relationships belong to the inspection company.
- InspectOS does not sell or broker customer relationship data.
- Tenant-level isolation and auditability are non-negotiable requirements.

## 6. Trust Before Automation
- Compliance and knowledge confidence come before aggressive automation.
- Cited answers and explainability are required in legal/standards contexts.
- Automations should be introduced after users trust platform recommendations.

## 7. Parity Is Admission, Not Differentiation
- Baseline expectations (tracking, exports, reminders, tagging) are table stakes.
- We ship these quickly, but we do not center strategy on parity features.

## 8. Default to Operational Truth
- Dashboards should reflect complete economics, not vanity metrics.
- Revenue without cost context is incomplete and should not be treated as core insight.
- Reports should expose assumptions and data lineage where possible.

## 9. Build for the Owner at the Desk
- The field inspector experience matters, but owner leverage drives expansion.
- Product prioritization favors capabilities that improve management decisions and team-level performance.

## 10. Compounding Advantage
- We design for long-term data compounding across orders, services, and outcomes.
- Analytical capabilities should improve as historical data grows.
- Features that create durable model/data moats get priority over one-off UX novelty.

## Product Promise (External)
Your clients belong to you.
InspectOS will never sell, market, or broker your customer relationships.
